Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a long running 5v5 tactical first person shooter game. My app gives players somewhere to strategize on a map by map basis, the best possible attacking and defending strategies.

The app will do this by giving the user the ability to select between planning on both the attack and defense side of the game. R6 Planner will also include the affordance to select operators, describe each operator's roll based on the selected “site” within each individual map. Additionally the user will be able to see their own “saved strategies”. The user will be able to select saved strategies by map, site, and based on attack or defense.
